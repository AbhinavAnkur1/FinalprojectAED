INFO 5100: Final Project
Health Care Management System

Problem Statement:
Our hospital needs an effective and efficient HealthCare Management System (HMS) that can be used to manage all aspects of the hospital’s operations, including patient information, appointment scheduling, billing, and medical records. We need an HMS that is user-friendly, secure, and capable of managing data and providing insights through analytics. Furthermore, we need an HMS that can be integrated with other systems, such as Electronic Medical Records (EMR), patient portals, and internal data management systems.
Purpose:
The purpose of a healthcare management system is to streamline the administrative and clinical processes of a healthcare organization. It facilitates the efficient running of the hospital by helping to manage patient information, patient billing, scheduling, and inventory management. It also helps to improve communication between doctors and other departments within the hospital. Additionally, a hospital management system helps to monitor the performance of the hospital and its staff in order to ensure the quality of care provided.

Approach:

This application will follow the Ecosystem approach. Hospital, Insurance, Blood bank and Police stays at the enterprise level. Each enterprise will have organizations. 

Reception admin will handle ambulance records, patient, billing.

Doctor admin will add doctors, their speciality, and their work id & experience.

Ambulance admin can add ambulance drivers and update their status.
