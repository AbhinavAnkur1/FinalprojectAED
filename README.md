INFO 5100: Final Project
Health Care Management System

Problem Statement:
Our hospital needs an effective and efficient HealthCare Management System (HMS) that can be used to manage all aspects of the hospital’s operations, including patient information, appointment scheduling, billing, and medical records. We need an HMS that is user-friendly, secure, and capable of managing data and providing insights through analytics. Furthermore, we need an HMS that can be integrated with other systems, such as Electronic Medical Records (EMR), patient portals, and internal data management systems.
Purpose:
The purpose of a healthcare management system is to streamline the administrative and clinical processes of a healthcare organization. It facilitates the efficient running of the hospital by helping to manage patient information, patient billing, scheduling, and inventory management. It also helps to improve communication between doctors and other departments within the hospital. Additionally, a hospital management system helps to monitor the performance of the hospital and its staff in order to ensure the quality of care provided.

Approach:

This application will follow the Ecosystem approach. Hospital, Insurance, Blood bank and Police stays at the enterprise level. Each enterprise will have organizations. 

Reception admin will handle ambulance records, patient, billing.

Doctor admin will add doctors, their speciality, and their work id & experience.

Ambulance admin can add ambulance drivers and update their status.

Pharmacy admin will update the inventory and will be responsible for medicine delivery.

Lab admin will add and update the test and delivers the report to the doctor.

Blood bank admin will deliver the blood samples.

Insurance manager approves the insurance request placed by reception and will send the request for police verification

Police Officer checks and verifies the patient’s insurance and approves.

Doctor will request lab tests, blood sample and prescribe medicine
Doctor will also have the record of previous treatment history

A user can directly go to the health care and contact reception or he can reach out ambulance for assistance.
